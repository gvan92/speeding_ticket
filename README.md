Python Creating a Simple GUI

This is a simple GUI application in python.

The program helps users calculate the speeding fine given the penalties, the speeding limit and the clocked speed. 
The fine is the minimum $50 plus $5 for every mile over the speed limit. If the speed is 50 mph over the limit, an additional $200 is added.
